## üöÄ Getting Started

Getting started is as simple as running a single command.

### Prerequisites

-   **Windows Operating System**
-   **PowerShell 5.1** or higher (pre-installed on Windows 10 and 11).

### Method 1: Using the Automatic Updater (Recommended)

This is the easiest and most recommended way to get started. Simply download and run the updater file.

1.  **Download the Updater**:
    -   Go to the project repository: [https://github.com/MBNpro-ir/spicetify-plus](https://github.com/MBNpro-ir/spicetify-plus)
    -   Find and download the `spicetify-plus-updater.bat` file.

2.  **Run the file**:
    -   Double-click on the downloaded file (`spicetify-plus-updater.bat`).
    -   The script will automatically request administrator privileges, download the latest version of `spicetify-plus.ps1`, and run it for you.

### Method 2: Direct PowerShell Execution

This method downloads and runs the latest version of the script directly in PowerShell without saving any files permanently.

1.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
    Right-click on the Windows Start Menu and select **"Windows Terminal (Admin)"** or **"PowerShell (Admin)"**.

2.  **Run the Command**:
    Copy and paste the entire command below into the PowerShell window and press Enter.

    ```powershell
    Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MBNpro-ir/spicetify-plus/main/spicetify-plus.ps1" | Invoke-Expression
    ```

    *This command fetches the script content and executes it in memory.*

3.  **Use the Menu**:
    The interactive menu will appear. Simply enter the number corresponding to your desired action and press Enter.

### Method 3: Manual Script Download

If you prefer to download the script before running it, follow these steps.

1.  **Download the Script**:
    -   Go to the project repository: [https://github.com/MBNpro-ir/spicetify-plus](https://github.com/MBNpro-ir/spicetify-plus)
    -   Click on the `spicetify-plus.ps1` file.
    -   Click the **"Raw"** button, then right-click on the page and select **"Save As..."** to save the file to your computer (e.g., in your `Downloads` folder).

2.  **Open PowerShell as Administrator**:
    Right-click on the Windows Start Menu and select **"Windows Terminal (Admin)"** or **"PowerShell (Admin)"**.

3.  **Navigate to the File Location**:
    Use the `cd` command to go to the directory where you saved the script. For example:
    ```powershell
    cd C:\Users\YourUser\Downloads
    ```

4.  **Set Execution Policy (if needed)**:
    If this is your first time running a local script, you may need to bypass the execution policy for this single instance.
    ```powershell
    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
    ```

5.  **Run the Script**:
    Execute the script by typing its name:
    ```powershell
    .\spicetify-plus.ps1
    ```

6.  **Use the Menu**:
    The interactive menu will now be displayed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

This script was designed to be robust, but here are solutions to common issues:

### GitHub API Rate Limit Error

-   **Problem**: You see an error message like `API rate limit exceeded`. This happens when too many unauthenticated requests are made to GitHub from your IP address.
-   **Solution**: This script includes a built-in GitHub personal access token to prevent this. However, if this token expires or is revoked, you may encounter this issue. To fix it:
    1.  [Generate a new Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) on GitHub (no scopes/permissions are required).
    2.  Open the `spicetify-plus.ps1` script in a text editor.
    3.  Find the line `$Global:githubToken = "..."` at the top of the script.
    4.  Replace the old token with your new one.
